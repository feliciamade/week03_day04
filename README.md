## Assignment: Aspen's Adventure Gallery
![Example](Example/Part1.gif)

This assignment involves creating an interactive image gallery page themed around Aspen, a golden retriever. Students will focus on using JavaScript for DOM manipulation to handle dynamic content and user interactions. This gallery features thumbnails which allow users to select and view full-size images from smaller previews.

### Instructions:

**Part 1: Thumbnail button functionality**

1. When a user clicks the "view" button on a thumbnail preview, make the thumbnail's image appear in the large display window above.

   - Write some javascript for each thumbnail button so that, when **clicked**, the image in the mainDisplay is changed

      - Use the 'document object' to select the element with an id of "mainDisplayImage" and assign it to a variable called "mainDisplayImageHTML"

      - Access the "src" property on the mainDisplayImageHTML variable and assign the file path of the thumbnail's image to it.

   - use either CSS or javascript to achieve this
